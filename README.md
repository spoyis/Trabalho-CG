# Ds

Ds is an Open Source C++ class library for [OpenGL]-based graphics application
development. It contains classes and templates for math objects (vectors,
points, quaternions, and transformations), spatial data structures (grids,
trees, and bounding volume hierarchies), scene graph management
("[Unity]-like" scene object hierarchy and components such as triangle meshes,
lights, and cameras), and basic [OpenGL] rendering and ray-tracing support,
among others.

Ds has been employed in the teaching of subjects such as computer graphics,
visualization, and games, in undergraduate and graduate courses of Computer
Science at the [Faculty of Computing](https://www.facom.ufms.br) of the
[Federal University of Mato Grosso do Sul](https://www.ufms.br). Ds has
also been used in several research projects in physics-based animation
and geometric processing.

## Compiling Ds

The current master version is 1.1 and supports Windows 10 and later. All
headers and source files are in the [cg/](/cg) folder. The only dependencies
are [GLFW] and [Dear ImGui]. All headers, source files, and libraries needed
are already included in the [cg/externals/](/cg/externals) folder.
The project file for Visual Studio 2022 is located in the
[cg/build/vs2022/](/cg/build/vs2022) folder. There is also a pre-compiled
binary available in the [cg/lib/](/cg/lib) folder.

## Ds Demo

Ds Demo is a simple ray-tracing application built on top of Ds. The headers,
source files, and a Windows binary are available in the
[apps/cgdemo/](/apps/cgdemo) folder. The Solution and project files for
Visual Studio 2022 are in the
[apps/cgdemo/build/vs2022](/apps/cgdemo/build/vs2022).

The ray-tracing relies on bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) for accelerating
ray/object intersections. Also, the code includes a scene reader with a LL(1)
parser. The grammar for the specification of a scene and its scene objects is
[here](/apps/cgdemo/reader/grammar.txt). The scene file shown in this example
is available [here](/apps/cgdemo/assets/scenes/).

## Ds-Vis

Ds-Vis is a simple "[VTK]-like" scientific visualization library extending Ds.
The API contains classes and templates for datasets and processes. A dataset
consists of a structure (geometry and topology defined by vertices and cells)
and attributes (e.g., scalars and/or vectors at vertices and cells). The API
provides classes for point sets, triangle meshes, triangle mesh intancing,
and sets of graphics primitives containing points, lines, and triangles.
Processes can be sources (dataset producers), filters (dataset transformers),
and sinks (dataset consumers). Processes are connected to each other in a
visualization pipeline such that the output of a source or filter is the input
of another filter or sink. A mapper is a type of sink capable of rendering its
input dataset. Every actor in a scene has a mapper.

All headers and source files of Ds-Vis are in the [cgvis/](/cgvis) folder.
The project file for Visual Studio 2022 is located in the
[cgvis/build/vs2022/](/cgvis/build/vs2022) folder. A pre-compiled binary is
available in the [cgvis/lib/](/cgvis/lib) folder.

### Ds-Vis Demo

Ds-Vis Demo is a visualization application built using Ds and Ds-Vis. The
headers, source files, and a Windows binary are available in the
[apps/cgvisdemo/](/apps/cgvisdemo) folder. The Solution and project files for
Visual Studio 2022 are in the
[apps/cgvisdemo/build/vs2022](/apps/cgvisdemo/build/vs2022).

## Upcoming Changes

Some of the goals for 2022 are:

- Full API documentation
- CMake project and support for macOS and Linux with Clang and GCC
- Textured and transparent materials
- ~~Basic scientific visualization API~~
- Demos for 2D/3D neighbor particle searching with regular grids and
quadtrees/octrees
- BÃ©zier and B-spline curves and surfaces rendering API
